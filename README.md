# Quiz-Game
Created in Android Studio using Java. Application will let users
select between 3 different multiple choice quizzes to take. Order of the questions
are randomized on new plays.

The quizzes are based off of the lessons learned during my time in the IT Programming Course at NSCC.

User can select their username, then select between the three quizzes to take. You will have 20 seconds to answer a question before moving onto the next one.
You will be scored on how well you have done on the quiz.
